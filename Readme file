#Task 2 Project Discription 


Design Choices:

Color Scheme:

I chose a clean and modern color scheme with a white background (#fff) for the form container to create a sense of simplicity and cleanliness. The blue color (#007bff) for the button adds a touch of vibrancy and aligns with standard link colors.
Font:

I opted for a common sans-serif font ('Segoe UI') for better readability. Sans-serif fonts are clean and modern, contributing to a straightforward and user-friendly design.
Spacing and Layout:

Increased padding within the container to give the form more breathing space and a more elegant appearance.
Used spacing and margins to create a balanced layout, avoiding clutter and providing a visually pleasing form structure.
Decorative Elements:

Incorporated subtle floral elements in the form's corners to add a touch of visual interest without overwhelming the design. The flowers are positioned using pseudo-elements to maintain a clean layout.
Transitions:

Applied smooth transitions to input fields and the submit button on hover and focus for a polished and interactive user experience.
Features:

User-Friendly Inputs:

Ensured input fields are clear and user-friendly with appropriate labels and placeholder text for guidance.
Responsive Design:

Utilized flexible and responsive design principles to ensure the form adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, enhancing the user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Visual Feedback:

Implemented visual feedback, such as changing the border color on focus and hover, to enhance the user's understanding of interactive elements.
Pseudo-elements for Decoration:

Used pseudo-elements to add decorative flowers to the form, enhancing its visual appeal without sacrificing simplicity.
Challenges:

Balancing Visual Appeal and Simplicity:

The challenge was to strike a balance between a visually appealing design and maintaining simplicity. It required careful consideration of color choices, spacing, and decorative elements to avoid overwhelming the user.
Image Selection for Decoration:

Choosing the right floral images for the pseudo-elements required consideration of aesthetics and cohesion with the overall design. Testing different images was necessary to find the right fit.
Cross-Browser Compatibility:

Ensuring the design and features work seamlessly across different web browsers required thorough testing and adjustments to handle potential inconsistencies.
Responsive Design Challenges:

Achieving a seamless responsive design involved addressing challenges related to layout adjustmen
